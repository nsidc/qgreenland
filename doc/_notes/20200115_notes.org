* Jan 13, 2020 Meeting
- Use Trello if possible.
- Try to meet w/ George Roth next week (lead dev of qAntarctica).
- Some goals
  - Data that spans disiplines
    - Compare datasets of other Greenland data portals.
    - QAntarctica has focus on physical sciences.
- Three categories of data
  - Data that can be downloaded as a package that sits on user's computer and used offline. Included in everyone's download.
  - Disipline specific.
    - Data more specific to a particular area.
    - Could be disipline-specific extensions or at dataset level
  - Online data sources that require internet access. E.g., WMS layers.
    - e.g., itslive website has example of accessing data from qgis w/o having to download the data.
- Initial work phase
  - Explore qantarctica. 
  - Figure out what the workflow will be, along with documentation. Want to be able to allow others to follow the same procedures to put their own data into qgreenland.
- Do have some $ for develpment of qgis if it becomes necessary (we could fund a qgis dev).
- Collaborators
  - See project proposal
  - ISAAISK
- Website
  - Should be live later this month
  - Community/potential user survey
    - What kind of data do they want?
    - What do people expect?
  - Should have as much of the info in Greenlandic. QGIS itself has documentation in many lanugages, want to support development of Greenlandic docs as well.
- Datasets that we should add
  - Twila has a list of possible datasets. May not all make the cut.
  - Do not yet have a spatial boundary for qgis. We will want to include some ocean-related data. Should think about what our boundaries are.
  - How do we represent and/or present timeseries data?
- Hope to have v1.0 by late October. Want to be ready for AGU.
- 9:30 standups.
* Notes on quantarctica
- Scale bar and credits are "Decorations".
- A txt file with the same name as the layer name is the layer description. (tooltip hover)
- sea ice conc layer
  - an aux.xml file alongside  the .tif file gives layer statistics and the color interpretation.
- Only a couple of layers have .qlr files.
  - ./Quantarctica3/Geology/GEOMAP/ATA_GeoMAP_sources_poly.qlr
  - ./Quantarctica3/Glaciology/SAMBA Surface mass balance measurements/SAMBA_surface_mass_balance_measurements.qlr
- Where does Quantarctica_ColourRamp.xml come from / used for?
- QLR files: https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/appendices/appendices.html?highlight=qlr#qlr-the-qgis-layer-definition-file
* Data pipeline notes
** Reprojection of data to common projection (Polar stereo north?)
- gdalwarp
** Resampling (downsampling) basemaps
- gdalwarp
** Conversion to data format readable by QGIS
- GeoTiff mentioned in Data Management Plan, but might make sense to explore other options as well.
- gdal_translate
** Subsetting to spatial extent of qgreenland (yet to be determined).
** Styling?
- Use internal colormaps / styles where available? GeoTiffs may have embedded colormaps.
- Many style decisions will probably take place in the context of qgis itself.
- Some data could probably have generic styles applied as part of data ingest
  - Coastlines
  - Place names
  - DEMs
  - Contour lines
