# ArcticDEM add-on data

[The Polar Geospatial Center](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/) provides a [custom
Greenland 32-meter resolution
ArcticDEM](https://data.pgc.umn.edu/gis/packages/qgreenland/packages/addons/)
for users of QGreenland.

Two download packages are provided for the v4.1 ArcitcDEM:

* `arcticdem_v4.1_32m_greenland_dem_only.zip`: A ~4.1GB package containing only
  the 32-m resolution DEM.

* `arcticdem_v4.1_32m_greenland_dem_full.zip`: A ~9.5GB package containing the
  32-m resolution DEM and ancillary datasets (e.g., a "count" dataset giving the
  number of contributing DEMs for each pixel).

Download one of these add-on packages and place it in a suitable location in your
filesystem. Unzip the package and then follow the directions in the `README.txt`
file included.
