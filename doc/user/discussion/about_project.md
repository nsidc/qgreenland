# About the QGreenland project

Greenland-focused research, planning, and education crosses disciplinary
boundaries. With QGreenland, a free and open data platform, anyone can explore a wide
variety of Greenland-focused data identified by an [expert team and Editorial
Board](https://qgreenland.org/our-team).

QGreenland is a United States National Science Foundation EarthCube-funded effort (award
#[1928393](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928393&HistoricalAwards=false)).
Project development began in 2019, led by the [National Snow and Ice Data
Center](https://nsidc.org/), which is a part of the University of Colorado Boulder
[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental
Sciences](https://cires.colorado.edu/). In 2023, a second award
(#[2324765](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2324765)) was granted,
enabling continued work on QGreenland. The project is made possible through the generous
efforts of a wide range of collaborators.

The QGreenland Team believes in open and accessible resources. QGreenland is
built using free and open software, with development tools and workflows fully
documented on our [Github page](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland). We also
believe in FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible) data and
strive to include clear information about original data sources and complete
metadata. To the best of our ability, we aim to include data that are already
free and publicly archived.

As QGreenland development continues, we will be expanding our educational
resources, increasing optional data download options, and working to be as
responsive as possible to user feedback. We look forward to hearing from
you on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland/discussions) or by
[email](mailto:qgreenland.info@gmail.com).
