# QGreenland Custom QGIS Plugin

```{attention}
QGreenland Custom is no longer supported.
```

**QGreenland Custom** was an experimental QGIS Plugin for downloading a custom
set of data, including data which is not part of the QGreenland Core zip package
(for example, due to filesize constraints).

The plugin is no longer under active development and should not be expected to
work.

See the [QGreenland Custom
Documentation](https://qgreenland-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more
information.
