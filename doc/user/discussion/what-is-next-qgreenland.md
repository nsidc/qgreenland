Under this grant, we released QGreenland v1, v2, and v3. The QGreenland team
also hosted virtual (e.g.,
[1](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/),
[2](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-educator.github.io/)) and in-person
workshops, developed educational materials, and participated in conferences and
travel to Denmark and Greenland.

Under QGreenland's next award, we will focus on developing community practices
for data customization that QGreenland and other communities can leverage to
create consistent geospatial data packages. Learn more
