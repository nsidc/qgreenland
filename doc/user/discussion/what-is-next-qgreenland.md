# What is next for QGreenland?

The release of v3 completes QGreenland's original grant funding provided by the
NSF's EarthCube program and marks the start of planning for our next award.


## [QGreenland: Enabling Science through GIS](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928393)

Under this grant, we released QGreenland v1, v2, and v3. The QGreenland team
also hosted virtual (e.g.,
[1](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/),
[2](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-educator.github.io/)) and in-person
workshops, developed educational materials, and participated in conferences and
travel to Denmark and Greenland.


## [QGreenland-Net: Open, connected data infrastructure for Greenland-focused geoscience, and beyond](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2324765)

Under QGreenland's next award, we will focus on developing community practices
for data customization that QGreenland and other communities can leverage to
create consistent geospatial data packages. Learn more
[here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2324765). 

If you are interested in contributing data to QGreenland, we have added notes to our
[dataset compatibility guide](/contributor/reference/data-compatibility-guide.md)
about how to prepare for QGreenland-Net.
