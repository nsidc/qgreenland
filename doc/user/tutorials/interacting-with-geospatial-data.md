# Interacting with Geospatial Data in QGreenland Core

## Spatial Data Overview

There are two main basic kinds of GIS data layers: vector and raster.

### Vector Data

**Vector** data are composed of points, lines, and polygons and represent discrete features.
Examples of vector data are cities (points), roads and highways (lines), and geographic
boundaries like country borders (polygons) (Fig. 4). All of the vector layers in QGreenland are
GeoPackage (.gpkg) files. A GeoPackage is just a platform-independent file type for storing
geospatial data.

Fig. 4: Examples of **Vector** data layers in QGreenland Core: Points (towns and settlements), lines
(median January sea ice extent), and polygons (country boundaries).

### Vector Data Attributes

All QGIS vector data layers have associated attributes, or characteristics of the discrete
features. Attributes can be almost anything: city name, road type (highway, paved, unpaved,
etc.), land elevation value, population density, date, etc. The attributes of a data layer can be
viewed in tabular form by right clicking on the layer in the **Layers Panel** and selecting ‘Open
Attribute Table’ from the menu options, or by clicking on the layer in the **Layers Panel** and
then clicking on the Open Attribute Table button in the **Attributes Toolbar**. This opens
up an **Attribute Table**, where the columns are the various fields, or attributes, and the rows
are individual features. Clicking on and highlighting records in the **Attribute Table** will also
highlight those specific points, lines, or polygons in the **Map View**. Right-click any cell to
‘Zoom to feature’, ‘Pan to feature’, or ‘Flash feature’.

### Raster Data

**Raster** data are composed of grid cells or pixels, where each grid cell has its own value.
Rasters represent continuous data, such as land elevation, surface temperature, land cover,
etc. (Fig. 5). The resolution, which is the length of the grid cell sides of each raster dataset in
QGreenland, is indicated in the name of the dataset, e.g.: “Ice Sheet Velocity (500 m)”. **Raster**
layers in QGreenland are all GeoTIFF files, which are images with geographic features, such
as geospatial metadata and overviews/tile pyramids.

each grid cell in the raster is 500 m x 500 m and is color-coded by a velocity

## Layer Properties

Right clicking on a data layer in the **Layers Panel** and selecting ‘Properties’, or simply double
clicking on a layer in the Layers panel will bring up the **Layer Properties** dialog window,
which contains a variety of information about a layer (Fig. 6). The information is organized
into sections (or tabs) that can be accessed by clicking on an individual tab (e.g., Symbology)
in the left sidebar of the window. The tabs listed in a vector **Layer Properties** dialog window
differ slightly from those listed for a **Raster** layer. The tabs most relevant to a novice QGIS user
and that exist for both **Vector** and **Raster** layers are:

* **Information**: This section summarizes information about a layer, including its name, coordinate
reference system, spatial extent (geographic boundaries), description (abstract), and more.
* **Symbology**: Every QGreenland data layer has a predefined symbology, or visual representation
in the map view. See section 5.4: Editing Layer Symbology for instructions on how to modify or
customize a layer’s symbology.
* **Metadata**: Metadata is essentially “data about data”. In QGIS, layer metadata is information about
the data in the layer, including its name, description, citation, and link to the source that the data
was retrieved from. As outlined in Licensing, Citing, and Contributing, published
works produced using QGreenland are required to cite each dataset used in the work. Users can
thus simply copy a layer’s citation directly from its metadata. An abbreviated version of a layer’s
metadata can also be viewed by selecting a layer in the Layers panel and hovering your mouse
over the layer name.

**Note**: The QGreenland team has in a few instances included comments on ‘Noted
Data Issues’.  Read about ‘Noted Data Issues’ in the layer metadata. These are
currently noted for the ‘Populated places’ layer. Regardless, QGreenland
makes no guarantees about the accuracy and validity of data contained in
QGreenland.

## Data Projections

Data projections, or Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), define the coordinate system for
a QGIS project and data layers. The CRS for the current **Map View** is indicated on the right
side of the QGIS status bar. For QGreenland, the current CRS should be identified as ‘EPSG:
3413,’ which is the identifier for the NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North on a WGS 84
Ellipsoid CRS. Changing the CRS of the **Map View** will not change the underlying data, though QGIS will do on-the-fly reprojection of layers not in the selected CRS. It is possible to reproject a layer into a new CRS;
however, this transforms the data and can introduce artifacts. Therefore, it is recommended
that to reproject data, the user do so from the source data and not the data contained in the
QGreenland package.

### Scale-Dependent Rendering
Scale-dependent rendering refers to the scale at which a particular data layer will be visible in
the QGIS map display. This can make it easier to zoom in and out for certain data layers. The
user can turn on scale-dependent rendering for any layer by going to the layer **‘Properties’ ->
‘Rendering’**, checking the box for Scale Dependent Visibility, and then setting the minimum
and maximum scale dependent visibility. For scale reference, refer to the scale indicated at
the bottom of the QGIS interface in the **Status Bar**.

### QGreenland Data Layers
A complete list of all QGreenland data layers and their metadata, including information about
their original data source, can be found in the layer_list.csv file included in the QGreenland
download package.


## Identifying Features in Layers

One of the most basic ways to interact with data in QGIS is to use the **Identify Features**
button in the **Attributes Toolbar** to quickly view the attributes of an individual record (i.e., a
single point, line, or polygon in a **Vector Layer** or a single cell in a **Raster Layer**). **Note**: If you do
not see this button in any of your **Toolbars**, then you need to toggle on the **Attributes Toolbar**.
Either right click anywhere in the **Toolbar** area and check the box next to **Attributes Toolbar**,
or go to **View -> Toolbars** in the **Menu Bar**.

To use the **Identify Features** button:
1. First, make sure that the layer (not just layer group) that you are interested in
   is toggled on and selected (click on it so that the layer is highlighted) in the
   **Layers Panel**.
2. Click on the **Identify Features** button in the **Attributes Toolbar**.
3. Click on the individual point, line, polygon, or raster cell of interest in the map
   view. The record for the object selected will show up in a new **Identify Results Panel** 
   to the right of the map display (Fig. 7).
4. You can choose what information the **Identify** tool is showing you and how it is
   displayed by toggling the **Mode** and **View** options at the bottom of the **Identify Results Panel**.

![identify_results_panel](/_images/identify_results_panel.png)

Fig. 7: The **Identify Results Panel** that shows results from the **Identify Features** tool.

## Measuring Distances, Areas, and Angles

Another useful basic tool in the **Attributes Toolbar** is the **Measuring Tool**. The **Measuring Tool**
is a quick and easy way to measure distances between two points or along a line, area of
a polygon, or angles between geographic features or locations.

To use the **Measuring Tool**:
1. Click on the arrow to the right of the **Measuring Tool** button and choose if you
   want to measure a line, area, or angle. Regardless of which one you choose, a
   small window will appear.
2. If you are measuring a line distance, first choose your desired units (e.g.
   kilometers). Ellipsoidal measurements take into account the spherical
   shape of the earth and the project’s coordinate reference system. Cartesian
   measurements assume a flat Earth. For small distances, these numbers will be
   very similar, but for very large distances they can be very different.
3. Clicking first on one point on the map and then another will draw a line
   segment whose length will be indicated in the **Segments** box. You can draw
   and measure multiple line segments.
4. To clear the segments you’ve drawn, click on **New**.
5. To measure an area instead of a line with the **Measuring Tool**, you will follow
   essentially the same steps for measuring a line distance, except you will click
   and map out an area on the map instead of drawing line segments.
6. To measure the angle created by three points on the map, click on each of the
   three points to draw the angle. The second point you click on will serve as the
   angle’s vertex.

## Adding Text Annotations to the Map View

You can add a text annotation anywhere in the **Map View** using the text annotation tool
in the **Attributes Toolbar**.

To use the **Text Annotation Tool**:
1. Click on the text annotation button in the **Attributes Toolbar**.
2. Click on the place on the map where you want the text annotation to go. A
   small white box will appear.
3. Double click on the box to open a new window where you can write your
   annotation and choose the font you want to use, among other things (e.g., you
   can link the annotation to a specific layer).
4. When you’re done, click **Apply** and then **Ok** to close the window.
5. To delete an annotation, double click on it to open the dialog window, then
   click **Delete**.

## Editing Layer Symbology

Each QGreenland data layer comes with a predefined symbology (how the layer is visualized
in the **Map View**).

To modify a layer’s symbology:
1. Open the **Layer Properties** dialog window for the layer you want to edit.
2. Go to the **Symbology** section and modify the layer symbology as desired.
   a) For a **Vector Layer**, you can choose from a built-in set of QGIS symbols, and/
      or can change individual characteristics of the layer’s symbology such as
      symbol shape, weight, color, size, opacity, and more.
   b) For a **Raster Layer**, you can change the color properties of the grid cells, as
      well as characteristics like brightness and contrast. The opacity/transparency of
      a raster layer can be changed in the **Transparency** tab of the **Layer Properties**
      dialog window.

## Processing Toolbox

The **Processing Toolbox** is what makes the QGIS platform a powerful spatial data analysis tool.
The **Toolbox** is a collection of tools and prewritten algorithms that allow the user to perform a
wide variety of **Raster and Vector** data analyses. For example, the **Processing Toolbox** contains
tools for identifying features in a **Vector Layer** that fulfill certain criteria, extracting selected
features from a vector layer and saving them as a new layer, and calculating vector and raster
layer statistics. The **Processing Toolbox** can be opened in a new panel to the right of the map
view by clicking on the gear icon in the **Attributes Toolbar** or by going to 
**View -> Panels -> Processing Toolbox Panel** in the **Menu Bar**.

For more in-depth information about the Processing Toolbox see the 
[QGIS User Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html)

## Spatial Querying

Spatial querying allows the user to select specific layer features based on desired parameters,
or compare features from one layer with features from another layer based on their
spatial relationships or common parameters. Below we describe a specific set of steps for
completing various example query and analysis tasks; however, the QGreenland user will
learn through experience that there is very often more than one way to complete a desired
task in the QGIS platform. We will describe several query and analysis methodologies that
use the QGIS **Processing Toolbox**.

### Example 1: Selecting from Vector Layers for Specific Features
Which populated regions in Greenland have more than 5000 people?

1. Open the **Processing Toolbox** and go to **Vector selection -> Select by attribute**.
2. Fill in the following parameters:
   -Input layer = Populated places
   -Selection attribute = Population 2016
   -Operator = ‘>’
   -Value = type in ‘5000’
   -Modify current selection by = creating new selection
   These parameters are telling the program to identify all of the populated places in
   Greenland that have a population greater than 5000.
3. Click on **Run**. Close the window when processing is complete.

There are a couple of ways to view the selected data points, populated places in Greenland
with more than 5000 people. First, you should see the places that meet this parameter
highlighted in the map view (make sure the **Populated Places Layer** is toggled on). You can
also open the Populated places **Layer Attribute Table** and select **Show Selected Features** in
the bottom left corner. This will hide all records in the **Layer Attribute Table** except for the ones
you selected, the locations with populations greater than 5000 people.
If you want to create an entirely new layer based on this feature selection (Population 2016 > 5000),
you can do so by either 1) right-clicking on the layer you have just selected from and
choosing **Export -> Save selected features as...**, or by 2) selecting **Extract by attribute**
under **Vector selection** in the **Processing Toolbox**.

### Example 2: Vector Layer Statistics
What is the total number of people in Greenland’s populated areas?
What is the average size of Greenland’s populated areas?

1. Open the **Processing Toolbox** and go to **Vector analysis -> Basic statistics for fields**.
2. Fill in the following parameters:
   -Input layer = Populated places
   -Field to calculate statistics on = Population 2016
   -Statistics = Save to temporary file (or whatever your preference is)
3. Click **Run**.

The **Basic statistics for fields** window should automatically switch to a view
of the Log where you will see the results for the population basic statistics
(Fig. 8). The value ‘MEAN’ will tell you the average size of Greenland’s
populated places (702 people). The value ‘SUM’ will tell you the total number
of people in Greenland’s metropolitan areas (55,494 people).

### Example 3: Simple Raster Analysis
What is a good estimate of the Greenland ice sheet’s volume?

1. In the **Processing Toolbox**, go to **Raster analysis -> Raster surface volume**. This
   is an algorithm that calculates the volume under a raster grid’s surface.
2. Fill in the following parameters:
   -Input layer = Ice thickness (150 m)
   -There will only be one option for Band number
   -Base level = should already be set to 0 This is the minimum pixel value in the Ice
   thickness layer.
   -Method = Count only above base level (since we are interested in ice thickness values
   greater than zero)
   -Save the Surface volume report, the output for this algorithm, in a temporary file or in a
   desired location on your computer.
3. Click **Run** and close the **Raster** surface volume window.
4. You should now see a panel underneath the **Processing Toolbox** called **Results Viewer** (Fig. 9), 
   which will direct you to the location of the results html file for
   this calculation. Open the file.

The results file should contain three numbers: volume, pixel count, and area. The volume is
the volume of the Greenland ice sheet in units of m3. The results should show that the Green-
land ice sheet has a volume of 2,942,360,633,311,806 m3, or about 2.9 million km3.

### Example 4: Using the Raster Calculator
How does the maximum sea ice concentration (%) around Greenland and
the surrounding land masses in 2020 compare to the maximum sea ice
concentration a decade earlier (2010)?

The **Raster Calculator** is a tool that allows you to perform calculations on one or
more raster layers. For example, if you wanted to convert a raster layer that is in
km2 to mi2, you could use the raster calculator. In this example, we’re going to use
the raster calculator to subtract one layer from another. Note: There is a different
**Raster Calculator** that can be accessed in the **Menu Bar** by going to 
**Raster -> Raster Calculator**. This calculator is different from the one in the 
**Processing Toolbox** used in this example:
1. In the **Processing Toolbox**, go to **Raster analysis -> Raster calculator**.
2. In the window that appears, you are going to build a mathematical expression
   using the layers and operators in the **Expression Box**:
   a) In the **Layers** box, scroll down and double click on the March2020@1 layer (this
       is the layer for the NSIDC’s sea ice concentration data from March 2020). You
       should see it show up in the **Expression Box** in quotations (“ “).
   b) Either type in the minus (-) symbol or click on it under **Operators**. It should show
       up after the layer you just chose.
   c) In the **Layers** box, scroll to and double click on the March2010@1 layer. It should
      show up after the minus sign, again in quotations (Fig. 10).
   d) For **Reference layer**, it’s recommended you choose either of the two layers used
      in the expression. Click on the three dots [...] which will open up another window
      and allow you to choose the reference layer by checking the box next to the layer
      name.
3. Click **Run** and close the window.

![results_viewer](/_images/results_viewer.png)
Fig. 9: To view the results of the **Raster** surface volume analysis, click on the link
next to ‘File path’ in the **Results Viewer Panel** below the **Processing Toolbox**.

![raster_calc](/_images/raster_calc.png)
Fig. 10: The **Raster Calculator** expression for Example 4.

The output layer will appear in the **Layers Panel** (likely named **Output**). You can right click on
it and rename it if you like. The values next to the colored boxes below the output file (likely
black and white boxes) will tell you the minimum and maximum values of the resulting raster
layer. In this case, the numbers will be the difference in the maximum sea ice concentration
(%) between 2010 and 2020, where positive values indicate an increase between 2010 and
2020 (endmember = +80%), and negative values indicate a decrease (endmember = -95%).
