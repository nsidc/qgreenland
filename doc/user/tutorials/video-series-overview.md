# Beginner Video Series

## Overview

In this video series (~1 hour total), you will become familiar with QGIS,
download and browse the QGreenland Core data package, and explore the basic
geospatial data anlysis tools that make QGIS and QGreenland powerful tools for research,
education, and local decision making. The video tutorial series contains 7 short
video sessions.

## Goals

* Learn what data is included in the QGreenland Core Package
* Analyze Greenland data using geoprocessing tools
* Find analysis tools and data relevant to you or your classes

## Prerequisites

In order to get the most out of this series, we recommend the following:
* Follow the [Get started with QGreenland Core](/user/tutorials/get-started.md)
  tutorial for directions on installing QGIS and downloading QGreenland
* When watching the videos, click on the settings icon to adjust the subtitles
  (in English or other languages) and adjust the playback speed
* Take time to engage in the practice tasks and take notes

```{note}
The "Populated places" layer referred to in this video has been updated and moved from "Places/Community map
(crowd-sourced)" to the root of the "Places/" layer group in QGreenland v3.

This updated "Populated places" layer has a "Population 2016" attribute that should be used instead of the "population" attribute indicated in the video.
