# Beginner Video Series

## Overview
In this video series, you will become familiar with QGIS, download and browse
the QGreenland Core data package, and explore the basic geospatial data anlysis
tools that make QGreenland a powerful tool for research, education, and local
decision making. The video tutorial series contains 7 short video sessions.

```
### Goals

### Total Time
1 hour

```

In order to get the most out of this series, we recommend the following:
* Install QGIS on your computer. Go to [qgis.org](https://www.qgis.org/) and
  download the free QGIS software. QGIS version 3.16 is the oldest version
  supported by QGreenland.
* Download the QGreenland Core data package at
  [https://qgreenland.org/download](https://qgreenland.org/download). Go to [Get
  started with QGreenland Core](/user/tutorials/get-started.md) for more
  information.
* When watching the videos, click on the settings icon to adjust the subtitles
  (in Englishor other languages) and adjust the playback speed
* Take time to engage in the practice tasks and take notes

## Introduction to QGreenland (15 minutes)

If you are not familiar with geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial

```{note}
The "Populated places" layer referred to in this video has been updated and moved from "Places/Community map
(crowd-sourced)" to the root of the "Places/" layer group in QGreenland v3.

This updated "Populated places" layer has a "Population 2016" attribute that should be used instead of the "population" attribute indicated in the video.
