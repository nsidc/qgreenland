## Downloading the data
Next, you will need to choose a storage location to download the data. Select your location using the 
three dot icon, and once you have chosen a location, click the **Download** button. When the download
is finished, you will see a blue bar at the bottom of the window showing your downloaded layer. 
Click **Next**.

Next, you will be asked to select which downloaded layers you would like to add to your QGIS 
project. This will be a full list of downloaded layers, so there may be more than one layer listed
if you have used the plugin more than once or selected to download multiple layers at once.

Find your layer of interest and click the checkbox, then click **Add to project**. Once the layer has been added, you should see the new layer in the QGIS **Layer Panel** and in the **Map View**. Click **Close** to exit the plugin.
