# What is QGreenland?

![QGreenland examples](_images/qgreenland-examples.jpg)

QGreenland is a free and open-source Greenland-focused GIS environment for data
analysis and viewing, powered by [QGIS](https://qgis.org). QGreenland is delivered as a Zip package containing a core set of data curated to serve the majority of users. This package is referred to as **QGreenland Core**.

See our tutorial on how to get started with QGreenland Core
[here](/user/tutorials/get-started.md)!

```{attention}
The QGIS Plugin **[QGreenland Custom](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgreenland/)
(beta)** is no longer supported. This was an experiment, and we decided to go in a
different direction. It shouldn't be expected to work.

# What QGreenland *is not*

* The QGreenland project is not a data-production project. While we do
  process existing data, it is only to enable efficient and effective viewing
  in the QGreenland QGIS environment.

* QGreenland is not a navigational aid. Please see our
  [Disclaimer](/disclaimer.md).


# About QGIS

QGIS is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under 
the GNU General Public License. QGreenland is designed to be used by a diverse user group, 
from scientists to planners and policymakers to educators, and more. QGreenland users 
are able to produce high-quality mapping products to meet their unique needs.
And because the QGreenland data package is downloaded right onto the userâ€™s computer, 
QGreenland can be used in the field and in remote places without Internet access. 
Some additional larger datasets (e.g., satellite imagery) not included with the main 
QGreenland download package are available through online access when connected.
QGreenland was inspired by the free and open source [Quantarctica](https://www.npolar.no/en/quantarctica/) 
GIS data package for Antarctica.

this project. The QGreenland Core v2.0.0 download package was released in March 2022.
The QGreenland Core v3.0.0 download package was released in August 2023. Development
versions along the way will continue to be available via the
[website](http://qgreenland.org), with code fully documented on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland).

Although the v3.0.0 download package contains a full User Guide, updates and additions
are constantly being made to our documentation as we continue to develop QGreenland.
The most recent version of QGreenland documentation will always be available here on
Read the Docs.
