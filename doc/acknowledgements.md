# Acknowledgements

The QGreenland project team acknowledges the following people, organizations,
and projects for making our work possible and enjoyable.

## Prior art

The [Quantarctica](https://www.npolar.no/en/quantarctica/) project inspired
QGreenland. Our innovation on this prior work is open-source and reproducible
package creation. Thank you!


## Funding

The U.S. National Science Foundation [grant
\#1928393](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928393) funded the
development of QGreenland versions `1.x`, `2.x`, and `3.x`. Thank you!


## Editorial board

The [QGreenland Editorial Board](https://qgreenland.org/our-team) made it
possible for QGreenland to cover a wide variety of scientific disciplines at
high quality. Thank you!


## Open-source software

QGreenland would not have been possible without the following open-source
projects. This is not an exhaustive list -- if your project is listed in one of
the environments described in {github}`environments/README.md` file,
