QGreenland should not be used as a sole navigational aid while performing remote
research activities in Greenland or elsewhere. Always bring appropriate safety
and navigational aids (including hard-copies of topographic maps) when visiting
the field.

QGreenland is a data-viewing and analysis platform, and the QGreenland Team does
not create new data. QGreenland's layers may contain errors from the original
data providers. QGreenland makes no guarantees about the accuracy and validity
of data contained in QGreenland. Limited notes on known data issues have been
added to the 'Populated places' layer metadata. Also, some layers may not
perfectly align with each other due to unidentified georeferencing issues with
the original data. We recommend using the 'Greenland coastlines 2017' layer as
the best approximation reference layer for geolocating Greenland's coastline.

Note that some data were transformed from their native data formats,
projections, and resolutions for inclusion within QGreenland. The included
metadata (**Layer Properties -> Metadata -> History**) contains provenance information
on any transformations. All QGreenland GeoPackages and GeoTIFFs are projected
in `EPSG:3413`.
