# Beginner Video Series

Welcome to the QGreenland Beginner’s Tutorial Series. In this series, you will become familiar with QGIS, download and browse the QGreenland Core data package, and be introduced to the processing toolbox for basic geospatial data analysis.

This tutorial requires that QGIS is installed on your computer. Go to [qgis.org](https://www.qgis.org/) and download the free QGIS software. QGIS version 3.16 is the oldest version supported by QGreenland.

You can download the QGreenland Core data package at [https://qgreenland.org/download](https://qgreenland.org/download). Go to [Get started with QGreenland](https://qgreenland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/get-started.html) for a tutorial and more information.

The tutorial series contains 7 sessions. Click on a session's title to watch the tutorial videos. The goals of each session are as follows:

## [Session 1: Introduction to QGreenland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD0vkP5JUmA&list=PLSRiyMridUCwyu-vqpAFtm8bVERgTvs7q&index=1)

- Understand what geospatial data is

## [Session 2: Introduction to QGIS and QGreenland Core Package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8exrxhwme4&list=PLSRiyMridUCwyu-vqpAFtm8bVERgTvs7q&index=2)

- How to download QGIS and QGreenland Core package
- Obtain a general understanding of what GIS and QGreenland are
- Explore the QGreenland Core package folders

## [Session 3: Navigating the Core package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhboP5u5HqE&list=PLSRiyMridUCwyu-vqpAFtm8bVERgTvs7q&index=3)

- Navigate the QGIS interface
- Toggle panels on and off
- Turn toolbars on and off

## [Session 4: Layers and Properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAMw-_dFWng&list=PLSRiyMridUCwyu-vqpAFtm8bVERgTvs7q&index=4)

- Access properties, attributes, and metadata of layers
- Know the difference between vector and raster layers
- Identify different layer types in Layers Panel
- Change display or symbology of layers

## [Session 5: Processing Toolbox and Data Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znKeiV3-Amo&list=PLSRiyMridUCwyu-vqpAFtm8bVERgTvs7q&index=5)

- Locate and open the processing toolbox
- Select by attribute in a vector layer
- Run basic statistics on a vector attribute field including sum, mean, and range
- Calculate the surface volume area of a raster layer

```{note}
In our example, ‘select by attribute’ for a population greater than 5000 would only work on an integer field. In v2.0,  the
population size field is a text string and you will first need to use the field calculator to convert the population field into an integer. To do so:
1. Open up the attribute table, and click the ‘Open field calculator’ icon.
