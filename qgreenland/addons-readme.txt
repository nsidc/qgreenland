32-meter resolution ArcticDEM (digital elevation model): The Polar Geospatial
Center has provided a custom Greenland 32-m resolution ArcticDEM for added
detail. Two download packages are provided for the v4.1 ArcitcDEM:

* arcticdem_v4.1_32m_greenland_dem_only.zip: A ~4.1GB package containing only
  the 32-m resolution DEM.

* arcticdem_v4.1_32m_greenland_dem_full.zip: A ~9.5GB package containing the
  32-m resolution DEM and ancillary datasets (e.g., a "count" dataset giving the
  number of contributing DEMs for each pixel).

Download one of these add-on packages and place it in a suitable location in your
filesystem. Unzip the package and then follow the directions in the 'README.txt'
file included.
