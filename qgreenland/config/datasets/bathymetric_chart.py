            """The goal of the IBCAO initiative is to develop a digital database
            that contains all available bathymetric data north of 64Â° North, for
            use by mapmakers, researchers, institutions, and others whose work
            requires a detailed and accurate knowledge of the depth and the
            shape of the Arctic seabed.

            The IBCAO data set is included, as a regional compilation, in the
            global GEBCO grid
            [https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/].

            Disclaimer information:

            The IBCAO V4.2 Grid, should NOT be used for navigation or for any
            other purpose involving safety at sea.

            The IBCAO V4.2 Grid is made available 'as is'. While every effort
            has been made to ensure reliability within the limits of present
            knowledge, the accuracy and completeness of The IBCAO V4.2 Grid
            cannot be guaranteed.

            No responsibility can be accepted by those involved in its creation
            or publication for any consequential loss, injury or damage arising
            from its use or for determining the fitness of The IBCAO V4.2 Grid
            for any particular use.

            The IBCAO V4.2 Grid is based on bathymetric data from many different
            sources of varying quality and coverage.

            As The IBCAO V4.2 Grid is an information product created by
            interpolation of measured data, the resolution of the IBCAO V4.2
            Grid may be significantly different to that of the resolution of the
            underlying measured data."""
