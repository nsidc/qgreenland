            requires a detailed and accurate knowledge of the depth and the
            shape of the Arctic seabed.

            The IBCAO V4.2 Grid is based on bathymetric data from many different
            sources of varying quality and coverage.

            As The IBCAO V4.2 Grid is an information product created by
            interpolation of measured data, the resolution of the IBCAO V4.2
