            """Abstract for reference publication: Each summer, surface melting
            of the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet exposes a distinctive
            visible stratigraphy that is related to past variability in
            subaerial dust deposition across the accumulation zone and
            subsequent ice flow toward the margin. Here we map this surface
            stratigraphy along the northern margin of the ice sheet using
            mosaicked Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery from the end of
            the 2019 melt season and finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for
            smaller regions of interest.  We trace three distinct transitions in
            apparent dust concentration and the top of a darker basal layer. The
            three dust transitions have been identified previously as
            representing late-Pleistocene climatic transitions, allowing us to
            develop a coarse margin chronostratigraphy for northern Greenland.
            Substantial folding of late-Pleistocene stratigraphy is observed but
            uncommon. The oldest conformal surface-exposed ice in northern
            Greenland is likely located adjacent to Warming Land and may be up
            to ~55 thousand years old. Basal ice is commonly exposed hundreds of
            metres from the ice margin and may indicate a widespread frozen
            basal thermal state. We conclude that the ice margin across northern
            Greenland offers multiple opportunities to recover paleoclimatically
            distinct ice relative to previously studied regions in southwestern
            Greenland.

            The new official geological map of Greenland in scale 1:500 000
            is based on 14 digitized map sheets covering all of Greenland with
            ammendments in specific areas. The original digital map was released
            on the GEUS Greenland Portal in 2012 (Pedersen et al. 2013). The constant
            increase in knowledge calls for pertinent revisions of the map in
            order to keep it up to date. Over the past decade a growing number
            of new scientific publications have changed the understanding of the
            geology in some areas of Greenland. With the release of the present
            map version, the following geographical areas have undergone
            revisions:

            1. The Palaeogene North Atlantic Igneous Province of West Greenland
               (Pedersen et al. 2017; 2018; Larsen J. G. & Larsen L. M. 2022).
            2. Mesozoic rocks in eastern Peary Land in North Greenland (Bjerager
               et al. 2019).
            3. The Kilen area in North Greenland, based on the latest 1:100 000
               geological map and recommended visualisation of the 1:500 000
               geology as outlined by Svennevig (2018a,b).
            4. Mesozoic rocks of North East Greenland, from Jameson Land to
               Store Koldewey (Clemmensen et al. 2020; Bjerager et al. 2020; Surlyk
               et al. 2021; Andrews et al. 2021).
            5. Neoproterozoic rocks of the Eleonore Bay Supergroup on Kuhn Ã˜
               (Tirsgaard & SÃ¸nderholm 1997).
            6. South East Greenland between 62Â° and 67Â° N, where new updated
               geology was presented under the SEGMENT project (Kolb et al. 2016).

            The new map has undergone extensive quality control including a
            complete harmonisation of all lineaments and structure points, which
            was not previously implemented. The map legend can be downloaded from the Citation URL."""
