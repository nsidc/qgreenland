        Thanks for taking the time to propose a dataset to QGreenland. Please
        keep in mind that:


        * The _QGreenland Core_ package is designed to represent many different
          data topics and must maintain a reasonable file size, so we have to
          be selective. The best thing you can do to prepare for future
          development is to ingest your data into DataONE.

        * Since QGreenland does not have permanently funded staff, it may take
          weeks to months for our team to respond to your proposal. Thank you
          for your understanding!


        Finally, please review our [dataset compatibility
        guide](https://qgreenland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/data-compatibility-guide.html)
        for ideas for improving your dataset's compatibility with our project.

        Please explain how you feel this dataset would benefit QGreenland. For
        example, does it provide data from a scientific discipline or
        environmental aspect that's currently not covered?
